                    Significance:</h2>
                <p class="mb-6">The number twelve consistently emerges throughout Scripture as a powerful symbol of
                    completeness,
                    divine order, governmental authority, and the unified totality of God's people. Its recurring
                    presence is not accidental but a deliberate feature of divine revelation, woven into the fabric of
                    biblical history and prophecy.</p>
                <p class="mb-6">From the foundational structure of the twelve tribes of Israel in the Old Testament,
                    through the
                    establishment of the new covenant community with Jesus' twelve apostles, to the ultimate
                    consummation of God's redemptive plan in the perfectly ordered and complete New Jerusalem, the
                    number 12 serves as a consistent thread. It delineates the stages of God's interaction with humanity
                    and the unfolding of His eternal kingdom, demonstrating a continuous and coherent divine purpose.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-6">The pervasive biblical significance of the number 12 stands as a profound testament to
                    God's
                    meticulous design, His sovereign control over history and salvation, and the ultimate perfection of
                    His redemptive narrative. It assures believers of the divine order in all things and the ultimate
                    completeness of God's purposes for His creation and His covenant people, culminating in an eternal
                    state of perfect governance and provision.</p>
