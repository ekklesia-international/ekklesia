            <p class="mb-6 text-lg">
                The term "church" often conjures images of steeples, stained-glass windows, or a specific denomination.
                But
                what if we told you that the biblical understanding of "church" goes far deeper, reaching back into the
                very
                heart of God's redemptive plan for humanity? The Greek word for "church" is <em
                    class="font-semibold">ekklesia</em>, and its meaning is far more profound than just a building or an
                organization. It signifies "a called-out assembly," a people summoned by God for His purposes.

                <p class="mb-4">
                    The concept of a "called-out assembly" wasn't entirely new with the advent of the New Testament. In
                    the
                    Greco-Roman world, an <em class="font-semibold">ekklesia</em> was a democratic assembly of citizens,
                    summoned to deliberate on public affairs. It was a group of people specifically designated and
                    gathered
                    for a particular purpose. While this secular usage provides a linguistic backdrop, the biblical <em
                        class="font-semibold">ekklesia</em> draws its ultimate meaning from a divine calling, not a
                    human
                    one.

But what if we told you that the biblical understanding of church goes far deeper, reaching back into the very heart of God's redemptive plan for humanity? The Greek word for church is ekklesia, and its meaning is far more profound than just a building or an organization. It signifies a called-out assembly, a people summoned by God for His purposes."
