            <p class="mb-6">The number 40 holds significant symbolic meaning in the Bible, appearing frequently in both
                the Old and New Testaments. While it often refers to a literal period of 40 days or 40 years, its
                recurring use highlights specific themes, primarily <strong>testing, probation, transformation, and a
                    period of preparation or judgment leading to a new beginning.</strong></p>

                The number 40 in the Bible often marks a crucial period of time – whether days or years – where God is
                actively working to bring about a significant change, a trial or testing, a period of discipline,
                purification, preparation, or a transition to a new phase or covenant. It emphasizes the idea that after
                a period of intense challenge or discipline, a new and often redemptive phase begins. It's a reminder
                that even in hardship, God has a purpose and is guiding events towards a spiritual outcome.
